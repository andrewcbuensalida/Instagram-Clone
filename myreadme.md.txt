from instagram clone from scrimba. created a new react app from scratch.
copy pasted files into newly created folder. had to place images folder
into public folder. very important or else images wont load.
to upload just the latest commit, the one with hidden db config,
delete the .env first, then
git checkout --orphan <new-branch-name> 
then publish to github
couldnt get gitignore to work, even doing the **/*.env

now trying elastic beanstalk. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0g-FJ5Zbb8
does not work. didnt npm run build yet.
Error: A cross-origin error was thrown. React doesn't have access to 
the actual error object in development.
